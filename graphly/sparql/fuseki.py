    Fuseki-specific implementation of the Sparql wrapper.

    This class extends the generic `Sparql` wrapper to handle Fuseki-specific
    behavior, including query execution, data dumping, and chunked uploads
    for both N-Quads and Turtle formats.

    Key features:
    - Automatically distinguishes between query and update operations.
    - Dumps the full dataset from all graphs in N-Quads-like format.
    - Supports chunked uploads of RDF data, handling named graphs when provided.
    - Raises HTTP errors on failed upload requests.

        technology_name (str): Set to 'Fuseki' to indicate the SPARQL technology.
